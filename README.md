# Overview
This is an opinionated document built with the intention of creating consistent and easy to manage Ignition projects.


# Naming
Function names, variable names, and filenames should be descriptive; eschew abbreviation. In particular, do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word. All Pythonic naming is derived from [Guido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)'s recommendations.

## Names to avoid
- single character names, except for specifically allowed cases:
  - counters or iterators (e.g. `i`, `j`, `k`, `v`, et al.)
  - `e` as an exception identifier in try/except statements.
  - `f` as a file handle in with statements


  Please be mindful not to abuse single-character naming. Generally speaking, descriptiveness should be proportional to the nameâ€™s scope of visibility. For example, i might be a fine name for 5-line code block but within multiple nested scopes, it is likely too vague.

- dashes (`-`) in any package/module name

- `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__` names (reserved by Python)

- offensive terms

- names that needlessly include the type of the variable (for example: `id_to_name_dict`)

## Scripting

## Logging
Always include logger definition as the first line of a script module, or a script transform. Loggers should be defined with `system.util.getLogger()` and use the full package path as their name.

i.e. for a script located at `my_folder/my_script` the logger would be defined as:
```
logger = system.util.getLogger("my_folder.my_script")
```

## Function Length
Prefer small and focused functions.

We recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard limit is placed on function length. If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think about whether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the program.

Even if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few months may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find. Keeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to read and modify your code.

You could find long and complicated functions when working with some code. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a function proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you want to use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up the function into smaller and more manageable pieces.
